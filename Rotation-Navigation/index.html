            <p>The rate at which road accidents occur on our roads nowadays is so alarming and it is one of the major causes of death in our country. The accidents may occur frequently due to imperfect indications of poor warning signs on the road and carless considerations of the drivers. For some decade's methods like signage, speeds restriction, straitening bends were some of the main concerns of road safety policy.
This is occurring as a result of many factors with which the lack of alert when approaching an accident blackspot is a major inclusive factor. Though the provision of instant medical assistance can help save the lives of casualties, sometimes there might be a delay in the arrival of health practitioners due to various reasons e.g. poor road network. As the saying goes “prevention is always better than cure”, we were thinking about what we can do to reduce the rate at which accidents occur. However, as installing road signs and maintaining of good roads can be costly but very important in preventing road accidents, the provision of alerts when approaching an accident blackspot will make the driver be more careful and follow safety protocols to help prevent road accidents.
Therefore, we developed an application to be warning drivers when they are approaching accident-prone areas. This allows drivers and other road users (cyclists) to reduce their speed or take caution as they are reaching a black spot. The mobile application also comes with a voice module that constantly reminds users depending on how far away they are or how close they are getting to a blackspot and as such need to be extra careful. This will in turn help reduce the rate at which road accidents occur since it will give a notification to the user before getting to an accident hotspot.
